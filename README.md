# Chatting project

---

This is my third react app and I used all of react basic concept with some advanced concepts and my first firebase project!.

## New things that I learned

- working with material-ui
- firebase authetication (Google authetication)
- firebase realtime database
- firebase hosting
- managing a deeply nested state
- derivng designs from other websites
- working with async code with react hooks
- using cleanup functions
- using webpack (I used to use parcel in my personal project)

## Notes

- the app isn't responsive so I recommend using it on desktop devices of laptops.
